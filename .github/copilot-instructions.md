## Development Environment

For detailed setup and development instructions, please refer to our [Development Guide](../docs/how-to-develop.md).

### User Interaction

Consider the following when communicating with the staff.

- The staff is not technical. Explain in simple terms as much as possible and avoid software jargon.
- Any new code must be easy to maintain and understand, without significant coding experience.
- Always keep user documentation up-to-date for new features.
